- The backend is built on node.js runtime using ws(web scoket) library.
- Frontend is built using react.
- The project is just built to get some hands-on on web-sockets.

#To start the application first try to run the backend websocket server.
- Navigate to ws-be folder(**before this navigate to broadcast-chat folder**)
```
cd ws-be/
```
Install the dependencies as below:
```
npm i
```
Run the commad below to start the server:
